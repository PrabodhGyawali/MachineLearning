# MachineLearning
Repo with a bunch of ML projects that I am working with to get into the accelerating field of AI.

# Project 1:
## WebScraping movie tables on the net to compare movie budget and movie revenue
- Gathered data using a threaded script sending GET request to fetch a website's webpages (60 pages)
- Used BeautifulSoup to store to gather data per movie and store it onto a class
- Cleaned the data when passed into the Movie class's constructor
- Write to a tsv file 
- Create a Regression model (line of best fit) with 6492 clean data points in Google [Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yVl3doA694Grmn5fWZ63vA72ETmGvs47?usp=sharing) NOTE: Don't forget to add cleaned_data.csv to the Collab runtime env 

# Repository 2:
## Optimization and Gradient Descent algorithms

# Project 2:
## Predicting House prices with multi-variable linear regression
### Gather a bunch of features - using the three methods below
>Method 1: [Rightmove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices/oxford.html) ~ 38,086 properties 
>Method 2: Explore open-source statistics like [ons.gov.uk]
>Method 3: `sci-kit` learn free datasets

### Learning Objectives:
- Improve Web Scraping Skills
- Improve Regressional analysis apply gradient-descent algorithms
