# MachineLearning
Repo with a bunch of ML projects that I am working with to get into the accelerating field of AI.

I will be trying to get my own data through webscraping and writing scripts to fetch and execute API request.
- I hope to learn more about Postman to write automated scripts
- Learn more about the HTTP/HTTPS protocols and how signals are transferred across the web
